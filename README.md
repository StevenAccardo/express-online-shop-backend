This is a practice server that transitioned from  a node only server to an express server serving html files. Then to using a templating engine with files as data stores. Then exchanged the file store for a MySQL database, using straight SQL for database interactions. Finally included an ORM to create a richer and smoother interaction with the database.

As it stands now this is a store that allows a user to create/edit products. Allows them to be added and deleted to/from a cart. Allows for orders to be created from that cart.

This is only for practice.
